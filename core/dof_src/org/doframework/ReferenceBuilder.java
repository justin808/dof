/**
 * This is the basic interface for DOF Java "Reference Object" builder classes, each of which will
 * create a well-defined "reference object", which is an "immutable non-transient shared test
 * fixture object". That mouthful is hereafter referred to as a <b>"Reference Object"</b>.
 * <p/>
 * Objects in the DOF are defined by either text definition files with a handler class, or they are
 * defined by individual Java classes.  The advantage of using Java to define objects, rather than
 * using some file format, like XML, is that the classes will support automated refactorings.<p/>
 * <p/>
 * Reference objects MUST be immutable within your tests. In other words, any test code that uses
 * these objects should <b>not</b> cause them to change, directly or indirectly. Such immutable
 * objects can only depend on other reference objects or even scratch objects. The key aspect of
 * reference objects is that they NEVER change in the course of testing.
 * <p/>
 * There are essentially two types of persisted objects for testing: reference (immutable,
 * permanent) and scratch (mutable, transient) ones. The advantage of reference objects is that once
 * they are created, many tests can share the same reference object. With scratch objects, this is
 * not the case, and unique ones must be created for each test. Reference objects can depend on
 * other reference objects, but not on scratch objects. Otherwise, the reference object would not be
 * clearly defined by the implementor of this interface.
 * <p/>
 * If this object depends on objects created with text files, be sure to implement the interface
 * HasReferenceTextDependencies so that those objects get properly deleted if delete is called.
 * <p/>
 * It is <b>critical</b> that reference objects never get deleted other than by calling
 * DOF.delete(ReferenceObject ro) because the DOF caches these objects, and thus if delete is called
 * otherwise, then the object is returned even though it has been deleted!
 * <p/>

     * false if there are any existing dependencies upon this object. For example, if this is a
     * request to delete a customer record and invoices depend upon this customer record, it must
     * simply return false.
     * <p/>
     * Typically, this method should be defined in the superclass for the object defined because you
     * typically have many builder classes for a given object type, and the methods implementations
     * might be the same for both scratch builders and reference builders.

     * getReferenceJavaDependencies and possibly implement interface HasReferenceTextDependencies.

     * development of tests. Cleaning up reference objects in the tear down of each test will lead
     * to horrible performance issues. The whole point of reference objects is that these objects
     * can stick around.
